‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions & CI/CD
**GitHub Actions** is a powerful tool for automating workflows such as building, testing, and deploying code. While this project does not currently have any GitHub Actions workflows set up, here's how they could be used:
- **Automated Builds:** Compile the app on every push or pull request
- **Automated Testing:** Run unit and UI tests automatically
- **Release Automation:** Build and upload APKs to GitHub Releases
- **Code Quality:** Lint and static analysis on every commit

To set up GitHub Actions, create a `.github/workflows` directory and add YAML workflow files. Example:*
```yaml
name: Android CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '11'
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew build
```
